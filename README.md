# cdda_additional_tweaks
Some stuff that I made for personal use.
Currently added stuff
 - 2 professions (Cosplayer&Isekaid starts)
 
 - Item-box necklace for the Isekaid start 
   (basically OP item that lets you store 2-cars-worth of loot and the cars itself. Won't affect your carry weight and stuff won't spoil inside
 
 - Kind of advanced version of NV\IR goggles(military AR glasses) and crafting recipe for it
   (another OP items which has binoculars function+NV\IR modes+all the smartphone features except flashlight)
   
 - Some UPS changes
   (Can be worn like in Aftershock, but still be able to change batteries like in vanilla)
 
 - Locksmith kit is unbreakable
   (Some people including myself thinks it's stupid that such an item kit breaks like makeshift lockpicks)
  
 - A new heavy-duty electric motorcycle that comes with Cosplayer start
   (I would love to add it to vehicle spawn, but it would be time consuming as the way mapgen currently is working)
